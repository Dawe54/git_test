Go back to your terminal, or if you’re using Visual Studio Code, open the built-in terminal by pressing Ctrl + ` (backtick). Then type git status. Notice how the output is similar to when we created our hello_world.txt file before adding it to the staging area, except the README.md file is listed in a section titled “Changes not staged for commit”. The meaning is similar to the “Untracked files” section in that the file is not yet added to the staging area.
